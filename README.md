# SCT_ML_Task1 – House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

**Internship:** SkillCraft Technology (ML Track)  
**Author:** Prathiksha A H  

## Overview
Task 1 of the **SkillCraft Technology Internship** involved implementing a **Linear Regression model** to predict the **price of houses** based on features like **square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms**.  

The goal was to understand **data preprocessing, model training, and prediction** using Python and scikit-learn.

## Features
- Data preprocessing: handling missing values and feature scaling
- Implemented **Linear Regression** for predictive modeling
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R² score**
- Clean and structured code for reproducibility
